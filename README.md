From the main proposed process flow diagram of Phishing Attacks, two main parts bicurcate in which one is "Data Storage" and other is "Exploitation Mechanism".

It is crucial for a Cyber Security professional or any individual to understand the background process of the user data or information is collected and stored, thereafter, how a perpetrator exploits the data of the user and database, tricking
the server, and email providers to steal the credentials and sensitive information of users to perform the maliciousÂ activities. For this purpose I have created CODE SNIPPETS for Storing of data and then how that data is used
by an attacker to perform malicious activities.

Data Storage consists of the steps and processes (IMPLEMENTED JUST CODE SNIPPETS):
Database > Data Captured > Data Encryption > Data Retention Policies > Attacker Access > Access Logs

Exploitation Mechanism of the steps and processes (IMPLEMENTED JUST CODE SNIPPETS):
Attacker > Retrieval of Credentials > Decryption of Credentials > Victim Account Access > Perform Malicious Activities > Technical Measures > Covering Tracks.

The images of the proposed process flow diagrams of the whole Phishing Process flow is attached and with that the Data Storage and Exploitation Mechanism process flows are attached to understand the exact working of it with a clear visualization.
